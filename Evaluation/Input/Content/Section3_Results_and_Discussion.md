The PBPK model for paracetamol was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

- IV administration equivalent dose range to 365 to 1460 mg 
- oral administration equivalent dose range 300 mg to 1460 mg in the fasted state 
- oral administration equivalent dose range 2000 mg fed state 

The model quantifies hepatic metabolism via isoenzymes of Cytochrome P-450 (CYP), UGT1A1, and  SULT1A1.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).

Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic medication commonly employed to relieve mild to moderate pain and reduce fever.

Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, with a systemic bioavailability of about 60-90% [Ameer 1983](#main-references),[Eandi 1984](#main-references). Paracetamol is a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) I compound (highly soluble and permeable at the typically administered doses) that is completely absorbed predominantly from the small intestine. The rate of paracetamol 
absorption is primarily determined by gastric emptying [Statelova 2020](#main-references).

Paracetamol is eliminated through various metabolic pathways [Flint 2017](#main-references). In healthy volunteers, it is mainly metabolized to paracetamol glucuronide via different uridine 5â€²-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, and to paracetamol sulfate through sulfotransferases (SULT). In addition, it is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily by CYP2E1, to the reactive (and therefore potentially toxic) metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), and a small fraction (~5%) is also excreted as unchanged drug in urine [Prescott 1980](#main-references).

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulfate in (healthy) adults.

The presented Paracetamol PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Paracetamol-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Paracetamol-Model)).

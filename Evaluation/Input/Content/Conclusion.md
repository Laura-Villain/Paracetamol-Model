The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol in adults following single-dose administration in both fasted and fed states.

In particular, it applies metabolism to paracetamol glucuronide via UGT1A1, and to paracetamol sulfate through SULT1A1, and CYP450 isoenzymes.

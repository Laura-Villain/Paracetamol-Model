The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol in adults after single-dose administration after fasted and fed state.

In particular, it applies metabolism to paracetamol glucuronide via UGT1A1, and to paracetamol sulfate through SULT1A1, and CYP450 isoenzymes.

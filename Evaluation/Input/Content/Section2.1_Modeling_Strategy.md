The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#main-references)). The relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#main-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](#main-references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

First, a base PBPK model for paracetamol was developed and evaluated for a healthy adult volunteer for IV administration and oral administration. One study was included where paracetamol was administered to eldely volunteer. The mean PBPK model was developed using a typical European male individual. The model was evaluated by comparing the pharmacokinetic simulations with observed in vivo plasma pharmacokinetic data taken from literature for paracetamol and its metabolites (paracetamol glucuronide and sulfate).
If needed, drug-specific parameters were refined in the healthy adult model by fitting the simulated plasma concentration–time curve to the observed data.

Unknown parameters were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.

Once the appropriate structural model was identified, additional parameters for tablet formulations were identified. 

The model was then verified by simulating:

- IV administration  
- Oral administration in fasted state
- Oral administration in fed state
